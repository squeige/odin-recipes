  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Beef massaman curry is a famous Thai beef stew that is the best of 2 worlds - it has the texture of stew with the flavor of curry. The sauce is intensely savory, thick, and luscious. Make sure you are using a good-quality curry paste (like
    Maesri) so you will get great depth of flavor without a lot of work.</p>
